# SVM
This project focuses on using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify human cell records as benign or malignant, aiding in early detection of potentially cancerous cells. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that maps data into a high-dimensional space to find an optimal hyperplane separating different classes.
Objectives
Develop an SVM-based model for cell classification
Train the model using human cell sample data
Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning
Evaluate accuracy using key metrics like precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Methodology
The dataset used in this project contains labeled human cell samples with various features that help differentiate benign from malignant cases. The workflow involves:

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training
Feature Selection – Identifying key attributes that impact classification
Model Training – Implementing an SVM classifier to learn from training data
Hyperparameter Tuning – Optimizing kernel functions and regularization parameters
Evaluation – Assessing model accuracy using various performance metrics
