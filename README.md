# SVM
This project focuses on using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify human cell records as benign or malignant, aiding in early detection of potentially cancerous cells. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that maps data into a high-dimensional space to find an optimal hyperplane separating different classes.
